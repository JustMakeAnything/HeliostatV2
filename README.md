## ESPHome

These main folder is for the esphome files. Compile and upload them with:

**run .\heliostat.yaml**

To your ESP32. See [Esphome](https://esphome.io/) for details

## 3D Print

The STL files for 3D Print are in folder 3DPrint

There is a subfolder STL for the STL files
The folder SolidEdgeParts contains the design files for Solid Edge

### 3D Print settings

The parts can be printed with standard settings. You should rotate the parts to the flat side when slicing. Some parts like the axle and the SideNoMotor need supports. The HolderTargetSun is not printable in this design. I split the front and arm and printed them separately.

This is the design of the solar tracker.
The purpose is to evaluate the accuracy, power consumption and robustness of the solution

It consists of a small tacker with the same motors as the big heliostat.

The function is to find where the sun is. 
Although this can be computed, the motors may not be able to track the sun correctly. This can be checked.
The sun hits various light sensors (LDR) and the software adjust the motors to keep them in place
All scenarios need cloudy weather detectors.
All scenarios need rain protection

"Guessing"
* one sensor on the surface to measure the overall sun intensity
* 3 sensors in tubes at various distances
* The motors adjust position until the longest tube is lit.
+ Works for a wide angle up to +/- 30 degrees
+ fun to develop
+ cool experiment
- Not very accurate
- May need a lot of power for the motors during guessing
- Not clear if it works
- Only a few sensors needed
- Rain protection more difficult

"Measuring"
* A smaller hole projects onto a sensor array in a closed box. the sunray hits some sensors
* According to which sensor is hit, the motors can rotate in the correct direction
+ easy to control the motors
+ Only small adjustments needed
- Could loose the sun when it is too far away
- in cloudy weather this will loose the sun over time
- A lot of sensors are needed
- Building sensor array is more complex (diffusors may be needed)
- Rain protection difficult

Scenario3:

u             -----------|
n                       *|

"four quarters" or more
* Four sensors divided by walls
* The tracker moves the motors that the unlit sensors are moved into the sun
+ Easy to implement
+ Direction clear
+ All angles supported
+ Easier rain protection
- unstable in cloudy weather
- unstable in windy weather


Scenario4:
                         *|
S          |              |
u          |-- -----------|

"ESA Solar Orbiter"
* A plate is throwing a shadow on the sensors in the back
* The tracker moves the motors that the unlit sensors are moved into the sun
* Similar as the scenario above
+ Easy to implement
+ Direction clear
+ All angles supported
+ Easier Rain protection
- unstable in cloudy weather
- unstable in windy weather
